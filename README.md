## Statistical analysis of the mismatch field (MMF) from the roving paradigm

In MEG sensor space, we plot the GFP and run cluster-based permutation tests on standards vs deviants.
 
In source space, we analyse reconstructed activity in these ROIs: bilateral A1, STG, and IFG (using the centroid method).

These analyses can be run on the whole group of participants, a subset of them, or as a comparison between two groups, e.g.
- younger vs older kids
- phase 1 vs phase 2 (i.e. longitudinal)
- any other comparisons
