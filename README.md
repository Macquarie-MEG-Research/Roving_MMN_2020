# Statistical analysis of the mismatch field (MMF) from the roving paradigm

In MEG sensor space, we plot the GFP and run cluster-based permutation tests to compare standards and deviants. 
 
In source space, we analyse reconstructed activity in these ROIs (using the centroid method): bilateral A1, STG, and IFG.

The group comparison script can be used for:
- younger vs older kids
- phase 1 vs phase 2 (i.e. longitudinal)
- any other comparisons
