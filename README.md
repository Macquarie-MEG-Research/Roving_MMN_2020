## Statistical analysis of the mismatch field (MMF) from the roving paradigm

In MEG sensor space, we perform cluster-based permutation tests on deviants vs predeviants.
 
In source space, we analyse reconstructed activity in these ROIs: bilateral A1, STG, and IFG (vertices belonging to each ROI are combined using the centroid method). There are options to use either mne or lcmv beamformer (with fixed or free dipole orientation) for the source analysis.

These analyses can be run on the whole group of participants, a subset of them, or as a statistical comparison of the MMF between two groups, e.g.
> younger vs older kids
> kids vs adults
> phase 1 vs phase 2 (i.e. longitudinal)
